**Subject:** Strategic Opportunity: Plugging a $907k Revenue Leak  

**Executive Summary**  
My churn analysis has uncovered a critical retention gap. While our VIP customers are secure, we are losing revenue from our "Average Spender" segment.  
I have identified $907k in lost revenue attributed to customers who bought a bicycle once and never returned. The data proves that Cross-Selling Accessories is the specific lever to fix this.  

**The Financial Impact**  
I analyzed the "Mature Cohort" (customers with >12 months tenure) to identify true churn.  
255 "Average Spender" customers have churned in the last 18 months.  
The cost: With an average lifetime value of $3,556 per customer, this represents a $907,006 total revenue loss.  
In contrast, our Top Spenders have a 0% churn rate.  

**The Solution: "The Bridge Program** 
Our current strategy treats Accessories as low-value add-ons. The data suggests they are high-value retention tools.  
The "On-Ramp" Myth: Acquiring new customers via Accessories does not work (0% upgrade to Bikes).  
The "Bridge" Reality: Existing Bike owners who buy an accessory are 1.57x more likely to buy a second bike (58% vs 37%).  

**Recommendations**  
- Stop "On-Ramp" Spending: Cease ad spend targeting new customers for low-ticket items.  
- Launch "The Bridge": Shift budget to cross-sell campaigns targeting the 1,455 active "Bike Only" customers.  
- Operational Audit (US): Note that 74% of our total revenue loss is concentrated specifically within the US market. Before scaling, we recommend a "Voice of Customer" audit.  

I have the full SQL methodology and dataset available for review.
